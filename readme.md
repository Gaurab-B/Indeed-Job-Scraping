<b> Version 1.1 Scraping Indeed </b>      

The notebooks are to understand how the code works.    

Firstly, Go to indeed and search a job and location and find the 'div' with the class ='mosaic-jobResults'    

Copy that element and put it to temp.txt.    

Run the script.py and then enter the page of indeed that you scraped.  

Your output will be saved as a csv file.
